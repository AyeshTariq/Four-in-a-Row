# Four-in-a-Row
A simple web-based Four in a Row game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to generate a customizable n×m game board, insert tokens interactively, detect wins, and reset the game. Developed as part of an assignment to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and clean separation of concerns.
